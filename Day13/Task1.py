# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
#iterating from the range (1,20) and when it reaches the end it prints you got it
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# at 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# from 1 till 19
