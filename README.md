<h1 align="center">100 Days of Python üêç 
</h1>
</p>

I'm completing "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2025" course from Udemy.
Since my goal is to master Python, I chose to take this course in the hope it would provide more structure and better
guidance than I was getting while "self-learning".
While taking part in this course, I have been taking notes and what-not and attempting all of the course projects to the
best of my abilities.
I'll be using this repo as a way for myself to access them as, if and when I need them.
100 projects in 100 days. All the personal projects for Great professor and great course, really recommend it:
